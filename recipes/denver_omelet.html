        <p>
            The Denver Omelet is a hearty American breakfast classic that
            originated with railroad workers and chuck wagon cooks in the
            American West. This fluffy, folded omelet is stuffed with a savory
            mixture of diced ham, bell peppers, onions, and melted cheese. The
            combination creates a perfect balance of protein and vegetables,
            with the sweetness of sautéed onions and peppers complementing the
            salty ham. It's a diner favorite that's equally delicious for
            breakfast, brunch, or breakfast-for-dinner.

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a small skillet over medium heat
            </li>
            <li>
                Add diced onions and peppers, sauté until softened (about 3-4
                minutes)
            </li>
            <li>Add ham, cook for another 2 minutes until slightly crispy</li>
            <li>Remove filling mixture and set aside</li>
            <li>Wipe out the skillet for reuse</li>
            <li>
                In a bowl, whisk eggs with milk, salt, and pepper until well
                combined
            </li>
            <li>Heat the clean skillet over medium heat</li>
            <li>Add remaining tablespoon of butter and let it melt</li>
            <li>
                Once butter is bubbling but not brown, pour in the egg mixture
            </li>
            <li>
                As eggs begin to set, use a spatula to gently push cooked edges
                toward center
            </li>
            <li>Tilt pan to allow uncooked egg to flow to the edges</li>
            <li>
                When eggs are mostly set but still slightly wet on top, add the
                ham, pepper, and onion mixture to one half of the omelet
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle cheese over the filling</li>
            <li>
                Using a spatula, carefully fold the empty half over the filled
                half
            </li>
            <li>Cook for another minute until cheese melts</li>
            <li>Slide onto a plate and serve</li>
        </ol>
