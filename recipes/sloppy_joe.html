        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Sleepy Joe is a cozy twist on the classic Sloppy Joe sandwich,
            designed as the perfect comfort food for evening meals. This hearty
            sandwich features ground beef simmered in a rich, mildly spiced
            sauce infused with chamomile tea and a hint of lavender honey,
            creating subtle calming notes. The meat mixture is enhanced with
            sautéed onions, garlic, and bell peppers, then seasoned with a blend
            of traditional tomato-based sauce and unique sleep-friendly herbs.
            Served on a toasted bun, each bite delivers a comforting combination
            of savory flavors with a gentle, soothing quality. It's a creative
            variation that maintains the satisfying essence of a Sloppy Joe
            while incorporating elements associated with relaxation and rest.
