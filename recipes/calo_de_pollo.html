        <p>
            Caldo de Pollo is a heartwarming Mexican chicken soup that's both
            nourishing and comforting. This traditional soup features tender
            chicken pieces, fresh vegetables, and aromatic herbs simmered in a
            flavorful broth. It's often served with lime wedges, fresh cilantro,
            and warm tortillas on the side. This soul-warming dish is
            particularly popular during cold weather or when fighting off a
            cold, but it's enjoyed year-round in Mexican households. Each region
            might have its variations, but the essence remains the same: a
            clear, rich broth with fall-off-the-bone chicken and chunky
            vegetables.

        <ol>
            <li>
                Clean and wash the chicken pieces thoroughly, removing excess
                fat
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a large pot with water and add the chicken pieces, whole
                garlic cloves, bay leaves, and quartered onion
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium-low. Skim
                off any foam that forms on top
            </li>
            <li>
                Season with salt and pepper, then simmer for about 30 minutes or
                until chicken starts to become tender
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the carrots, celery, and potatoes to the pot. Continue

            </li>
            <li>
                Add the corn and zucchini. Cook for another 10-15 minutes until
                all vegetables are tender but not overcooked
            </li>
            <li>
                Tie the cilantro bunch with kitchen twine and add it to the pot
                for the last 5 minutes of cooking
            </li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if needed</li>
        </ol>
